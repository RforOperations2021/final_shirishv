# final_shirishv

This repository contains the code of final homework and its link to the R Shiny dashboard.

The dashboard is based on the Allegheny County's 911 EMS call data in the last 6 years (2015-20).
It shows the following:

- How has the number of calls changed over the years for a particular priority type? 
- How has the number of calls changed for a city over the years in each priority type?
- Where did those call originate from (a leaflet map)?

The dataset was taken from WPRDC's website: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-911-dispatches-ems-and-fire

Note: Leaflet map takes a little time to update as the dataset is huge!
